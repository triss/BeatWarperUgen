CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

ARGUMENT:: numChannels
Number of output channels.

ARGUMENT:: bufnum
The index of the buffer to use.

ARGUMENT:: length
The amount of time to stretch the sample over in seconds.

ARGUMENT:: rate
1.0 is normal, 2.0 is one octave up, 0.5 is one octave down. Negative rates are currently not supported.

ARGUMENT:: slices
An array containing the position of each slice as a fraction, 0 is the beginning of the buffer, 0.5 is half way through 1.0 is the very end of file.

ARGUMENT:: sliceLength
The proportion of the slice to play. 1.0 is the whole slice 0.1 is 1/10th of each slice, 0.5 is half of each slice.

ARGUMENT:: fadeIn
The number of samples to fade each slice in for.

ARGUMENT:: fadeOut
The number of samples to fade each slice out for.

ARGUMENT:: mul
Output will be multiplied by this value.

ARGUMENT:: add
This value will be added to the output.
