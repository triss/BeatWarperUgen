To install you'll require gcc, cmake and copy of the SuperCollider source somewhere on your machine.

First cd into the folder containing this README.

Next create a build directory:

mkdir build

And cd into that:

cd build

Create make files by running cmake and pointing it at you're SuperCollider source directory:

cmake -DSC_PATH=/path/to/my/supercollider/source ..

Build the unit generator with:

make

On OS X copy the generated BeatWarper.scx file to your SuperCollider Extensions folder. On Linux copy the generated BeatWarper.so to your server plugins folder.

Next copy the contents of the sc folder included with this file to your SuperCollider extensions folder.

Start SuperCollider and take a look at the documentation for the BeatWarper Ugen.
